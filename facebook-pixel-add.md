The `YOUR_PIXEL_ID` in this Facebook Pixel code is a unique identifier that Facebook generates for each Pixel associated with your account. Here’s how to find it:

1. **Go to Facebook Events Manager**: Log into your Facebook account and navigate to the Events Manager at [https://www.facebook.com/events_manager2/](https://www.facebook.com/events_manager2/).

2. **Select Your Pixel**: In Events Manager, you should see any pixels you’ve created. Select the Pixel you want to use on your website.

3. **Copy the Pixel ID**: Under your Pixel name, you’ll see a unique ID — that’s your Pixel ID. Copy this number and replace `YOUR_PIXEL_ID` in your script with this ID.

4. **Verify Implementation** (optional but recommended): After adding the Pixel to your site, you can use the **Facebook Pixel Helper** (a Chrome extension) to check if it’s working correctly.
